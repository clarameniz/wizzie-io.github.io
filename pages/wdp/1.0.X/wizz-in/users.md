## Overview

This section shows how to add users to an organization. It allows you to invite an existing user or a new one.

On the main page of the organization, we can see this section:

{% include image.html file="./wizz-in/users/wizz-in-users-list.png" url="./images/wizz-in/users/wizz-in-users-list.png" alt="" caption="Wizz-In organization users list" %}

## Operations

Using the interface, you can do the different operations:

### INVITE

Using the `+`, you can invite an existing user or a new one.

{% include image.html file="./wizz-in/users/wizz-in-user-invitation.png" url="./images/wizz-in/users/wizz-in-user-invitation.png" alt="" caption="Wizz-In organization user invite" %}

If the user is a new one, he will appear in the list with his basic information.

{% include image.html file="./wizz-in/users/wizz-in-user-invitated.png" url="./images/wizz-in/users/wizz-in-user-invitated.png" alt="" caption="Wizz-In organization user invitated list" %}

Also, he will receive an email with a link to accept the invitation and set his defaults.
